# containerfiles

These are Containerfiles I use with Podman on libostree-based Fedora distributions. Inspired by [jessfraz/dockerfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles), but not nearly as bountiful, because these are intended to be used on an immutable ostree host where it is not feasible to run inside a toolbox container. I will eventually convert these to [podenv](https://github.com/podenv/podenv) configuration files, but, for want of more comprehensive documentation, it will take time to decode how Podenv configuration (and Podenv itself) works.

Feel free to clone this repo and adapt these to your needs!
